        Hi!
        I go by the name Nathan Demissie. As of now, I am a student at AAiT, studying for my IT degree. Besides my daily routine at school, I happen to be interested in a number of hobbies like reading, writing, building and visualizing plans of practical equipments.
        Yet I find few things more interesting than finding out more about faraway places, the art of photography as well as how technology has winded it's way through human history.

        I always have found it to be a quite intesresting phenomena, that we humans are capable of detecting patterns and themes through out nature and our daily lives, yet many times are unable to think back in time to learn things that prove to be crucial at times in solving our many daily problems.
        Thus I have always found it quite fascinating to see photographs of the past to remind myself what thing things were like then; notice the many ways how the lack or advancement of technology affected people's way of lives and the shame or huberus it created for them. 
        To top it all, I couldn't stop myself from planning excitedly of my future ventures to places faraway, where people at different places and time lived and how they toiled through their days.
